## Usage

    go get github.com/dal-go/dalgo2sql

## End2end - is a separate module

For end-to-end testing a SQLite driver is used.
To avoid bringing a dependency to SQLite into the consumers of dalgo2sql,
the [end2end](end2end) tests are in a separate module.

This is an unusual approach, as usually you would want to bring dependency to underlying driver with a dalgo adapter.
But this is not a case for this adapter as `database/sql` that is referenced by `dalgo2sql` is an abstraction layer
and consumer is free to choose the underlying driver.
